## Dataset Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) - Waste Management Transfer Data

I'm bringing my development in analysis and competitions on Kaggle to GitHub. This dataset combines two things I'm passionate about: environmental science and data analysis. This notebook aims to explore and analyze the NPRI dataset, Canada's comprehensive public inventory of pollutant releases, disposals, and transfers spanning over 30 years (1994-2024). The dataset covers more than 250 chemicals across waste management practices in Canada, providing crucial insights into industrial pollutant transfers that have been largely underutilized in environmental research.

**Licensing and Use**: This dataset is sourced from Environment and Climate Change Canada and is available under the Open Government Licence - Canada. It is intended for research, educational, and policy analysis purposes. The data provides transparency into Canada's pollution patterns and supports evidence-based environmental decision-making.
